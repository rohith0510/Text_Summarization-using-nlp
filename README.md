# It imports necessary modules and libraries, including tkinter for GUI, scipy for natural language processing, Counter for counting occurrences, and nlargest for obtaining the top N elements from a list.
# The summarize_text function defines the text summarization process. It tokenizes the input text, removes stop words and punctuation, calculates word frequency, assigns weights to words, calculates sentence scores based on word weights, and selects the top N sentences for summarization.
# It creates a Tkinter application window with input and output text boxes.
# The input text box allows users to enter the text they want to summarize.
# The "Summarize Text" button triggers the text summarization process when clicked.
# The result box displays the summarized text.
# Finally, it starts the Tkinter event loop to run the GUI application.
